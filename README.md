# Spherical-Organization-AC
LAMMPS scripts and analysis codes for the Organization of topologically modified polymers under spherical confinement. Folder "Scripts" contains:

1. "InitialMC": Contains .f90 files for Monte Carlo simulations for creating the starting configurations used in the LAMMPS scripts. .txt files are the LAMMPS input files generated.
2. "Lammps_script": Contains the LAMMPS script for the Langevin Dynamics simulation of Topologically Modified Polymers under spherical confinement.
3. "Analysis": Contains .f90 files for the analysis of the position data of monomers generated after running the LAMMPS scripts.
