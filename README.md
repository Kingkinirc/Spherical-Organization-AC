# Spherical-Organization-AC
LAMMPS scripts and analysis codes for the Organization of topologically modified polymers under spherical confinement. "Scripts" contains 3 folders:

1. "InitialMC" has .f90 files for Monte Carlo simulations to generate the starting configurations used in the LAMMPS scripts. .txt files are the LAMMPS input files generated.
2. "Lammps_script" has the LAMMPS scripts for the Langevin Dynamics simulation of Topologically Modified Polymers under spherical confinement.
3. "Analysis" has .f90 files for the analysis of the position data of monomers generated after running the LAMMPS scripts.
